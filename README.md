# How I created a digital clock with glowing in effect

A digital clock or watch in which the hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds are indicated by digits, as opposed to an analog clock, where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands. If you're searching for Working Analog Clock.

Generally, this clock takes real-time from our pcs/computers not from the server and show on the webpage. Using Javascript new Date() method I fetched real-time from my current PC. 

 I used the only CSS to create a glowing background effect and animate it with the CSS @keyframes property. But to show the realtime I used pure JavaScript.
